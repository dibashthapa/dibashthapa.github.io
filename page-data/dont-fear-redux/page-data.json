It is most commonly used with <strong>React</strong>.\nIn simple words , It is just a tool to manage the state between components</p>\n<h2><strong>How did I learn Redux ?</strong></h2>\n<p>As you know , how hard is to learn Redux for a complete beginner. I searched it on youtube, but I didn't find a good video , which could give me the better understanding of redux. Finally , I landed a good tutorial by <strong>Hitesh Choudhary</strong>. He helped me to understand the Redux in an easy way.</p>\n<p>If you are having a hard time to learn Redux, then you can watch his video on Youtube\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np8A_aW7Pew\" title=\"Redux\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/np8A_aW7Pew/0.jpg\"></a></p>\n<h2><strong>How did I use to implement Redux ?</strong></h2>\n<p>First , I would create a <strong>store</strong> folder inside the <strong>src</strong> directory. And , Inside the <strong>store</strong> directory , I would create <strong>actions.js</strong> , <strong>reducers.js</strong> and <strong>index.js</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>actions.js</strong> for adding the name of the actions and functions</li>\n<li><strong>reducers.js</strong> for managing the state , when an action is dispatched</li>\n<li><strong>index.js</strong> for exporting the <strong>actions</strong> and <strong>reducers</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How did I stop fearing about Redux?</strong></h2>\n<p>Well , I thought I was doing it in a wrong way, until I saw the code of my company project. After learning React for 6 months , I finally applied for a job and luckily I was selected too. I was assigned to create a <strong>dashboard</strong> for vendor admin in <strong>POS</strong> system.</p>\n<p>I saw multiple reducers and actions used for <strong>Dashboard</strong> page. I was afraid and sweating, because I used to think , using multiple actions and reducer for simple tasks would be considered a bad practice. But, It wasn't. Multiple actions and reducers were used in multiple components and pages. I was shocked for a moment.</p>\n<p>For my personal react projects , I used to use <strong>Redux</strong> only for managing the auth state. I used to use axios for <strong>CRUD</strong> actions , although it could be easily managed by <strong>Redux</strong>.</p>\n<p>There were multiple <strong>store</strong> folder for multiple components in my company project. I used Redux for managing the CRUD operations. And it was fun. All that fear that I had before was gone by just implementing multiple actions and reducers. I created multiple components and multiple redux actions for managing the business logic applications.</p>\n<p>It was a good experience to work with the experienced developers. I learned how to use redux. I saw my senior dev using <strong>Promise</strong> to call the <strong>resolve</strong> and <strong>reject</strong> function using redux saga. LOL , I never thought that I could call <strong>Promise</strong> by dispatching the <strong>actions</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Redux is not complicated. You have to use Redux in multiple components to understand it much easily.</p>\n<p>It is hard to configure Redux for you react application. Still , I have to copy and paste to configure Redux for my react application. Though , I understand how it works under the hood, I still have a hard time to configure it.
